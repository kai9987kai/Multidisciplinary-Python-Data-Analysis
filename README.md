# Multidisciplinary-Python-Data-Analysis
A Python script demonstrating various data analysis techniques including numerical computation, data manipulation, machine learning, visualization, and natural language processing.


Numerical computation (numpy): It uses numpy to generate a synthetic dataset for a simple linear regression task. The independent variable X is a set of random numbers, and the dependent variable y is a linear function of X with some random noise added.

python
Copy code
X = np.random.rand(100, 1)
y = 2 + 3 * X + np.random.rand(100, 1)
Data manipulation (pandas): The X and y arrays are combined into a pandas DataFrame for easier data manipulation.

python
Copy code
df = pd.DataFrame(np.hstack([X, y]), columns=['X', 'y'])
Machine learning (scikit-learn): The synthetic dataset is split into training and test sets, and a simple linear regression model is trained on the training set.

python
Copy code
train_df, test_df = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(train_df[['X']], train_df['y'])
Natural language processing (nltk): The script tokenizes a simple sentence and counts the number of words.

python
Copy code
sentence = "This is a simple sentence for tokenization."
tokens = word_tokenize(sentence)
In a real-world scenario, you would likely replace the synthetic data with actual data relevant to your task. The rest of the script demonstrates how you might use numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and nltk to analyze and model your data.
